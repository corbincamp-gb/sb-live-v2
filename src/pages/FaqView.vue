                                            the internship includes members of the general public. If Company X offers

                                            participating in the internship, the service member may accept the offer if
                                            it is also extended to the participating members of the general public.</p>

                                            is invited to interview with Company X at its headquarters in another state.
                                            Company X HQ offers to pay for your interview travel expenses. However,
                                            members of the general public who also participate in the internship are not
                                            provided travel expenses when invited to an interview. Because the interview
                                            travel expenses are not offered to all invitees, the service member may NOT
                                            accept the travel expenses from Company X to attend the interview at the HQ.
